# scripts/check_doctrines.sh — THE GENERAL DOCTRINE ENFORCER (driver + registry).
#
# Runs every mechanizable doctrine check as one registry, reports per-doctrine
# PASS/FAIL, and exits NONZERO on any breach. Called by .githooks/pre-commit
# (fast local gate) and by CI (the backstop a local --no-verify cannot dodge).
#
# Enforcement layering (defense in depth):
#   E1 discovery  : the doctrine docs (README, MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE, TOOLBOX, docs/decisions/).
#   E2 self-check : THIS script + each registered scripts/check_*.sh (single source of truth).
#   E3 git hook   : .githooks/pre-commit calls this (activate via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`).
#   E4 CI         : the same script runs in CI so a bypassed local hook still fails the build.
#
# To add a PROJECT-SPECIFIC doctrine, append a check to scripts/check_doctrines.project.sh
# (the pluggable slot) — never edit this driver's universal registry.
set -uo pipefail   # deliberately NOT -e: run ALL checks, collect every result, then report.
