# LIVE-DOC-CURRENCY — a live document carries no SELF-REPORTED currency field. Exits NONZERO on
# breach. Called by scripts/check_doctrines.sh via .githooks/pre-commit (E3) and CI (E4).
#
# THE RULE: no tracked Markdown file states `Last updated: <date>` (or `Last-updated`,
# `Last modified`, `Updated on`) about itself. Git already records when every line changed, and it
# cannot be wrong; a hand-maintained date is right on the day it is typed and false the day after,
# and a reader who trusts it is misled precisely when it matters. Measured in the originating
# project (LIVE-MEANS-LIVE.4a, 2026-07-31): the field was DELETED repo-wide after it was found
# stale on the very documents whose currency it claimed; the template inherits the deletion, not
# the field. Ported by BEDROCK-MAINTENANCE.2.5 as the principle; the upstream instrument that
# additionally scores distinct dates per live surface against a declared charter stays a backlog
# item (it needs a per-project charter).
#
# ARCHETYPE: structural (DOCTRINE_ENFORCEMENT.md §3) — re-derived from the tracked text on every
# run, over the CLOSED population `git ls-files '*.md'`; nothing is assumed about which files are
# "live". A date inside prose ("released 2026-07-30") is not a currency field and is not matched;
# only a field-shaped line — the label at the start of the line, followed by a colon — is.
#
# CONTRACT (DOCTRINE_ENFORCEMENT.md §4): exit code is the verdict; explains on stderr;
# deterministic; read-only; path-agnostic; fast.  `--self-test` proves both arms fire.
