# ROUTING-EVIDENCE — a task leaf that routes a finding OUT to a DIFFERENT task tree must record
# what it measured before deciding the finding belongs to that family.
#
# Provenance: an incident in the originating project (ported by BEDROCK-MAINTENANCE.2.6): a leaf
# routed a target-accounting mismatch to another family as "that family's model, not the shared
# gate". It was neither — the defect sat in the SHARED gate, the same run got a second family wrong
# the same way, and the evidence that settled it (cross-family arithmetic over the run's own
# summary) was already on disk at routing time. The misroute cost a session.
#
# THE RULE
#   If a staged `docs/tasks/A.md` adds a line that routes a finding to a DIFFERENT tree, that file
#   must contain a `ROUTING EVIDENCE` section. Otherwise: block, and quote the line.
#
#   The discriminator is routing OUT OF THE TREE, deliberately. `routed to .4` (a leaf of the same
#   tree) is ordinary intra-tree bookkeeping and is the common case (measured upstream: 17 such
#   lines, 0 flagged). Flagging those would be noise, and a check that cries wolf gets bypassed.
#
# ⚠️ THE FIRST CUT UPSTREAM WOULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT ITS OWN FOUNDING INCIDENT: it was keyed on the
#   destination being spelled as a tree ID. The predicate is keyed on the SEMANTICS of leaving the
#   tree instead, and `--self-test` pins the founding phrasing.
#
# ⚠️ KNOWN FALSE-POSITIVE CLASS: a leaf that merely DISCUSSES routing — quoting the trigger phrases,
#   as the leaf documenting this doctrine must — fires it. Accepted: the discharge is one section, it
#   errs toward asking rather than staying silent, and narrowing around quotation would re-introduce
#   the phrasing-guessing that made the first cut miss.
#
# ARCHETYPE: evidence. HONEST LIMIT — this verifies the reasoning was RECORDED, not that the
#   reproduction was attempted or that its conclusion was right.
# CONTRACT: exit code is the verdict; explains on stderr; deterministic; read-only;
#   staged-scope-aware; path-agnostic; fast.
