# HANDOFF BACKGROUND-JOB CENSUS — maintainer standing rule (2026-08-30, ported by BEDROCK-MAINTENANCE.2.5).
#
#   "at a handoff point, that is whenever I am ready to /exit, ensure there is
#    no background job running."
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. In the originating project a task tree was opened on a checkout that the
# resume pointer said was clean and that was in fact being REWRITTEN under it: a chain script
# from a session that no longer existed had been running for 1 h 24 m, overwriting three
# TRACKED artifacts of an already-closed leaf at a different configuration, with its log gone
# with the session. A background job outlives the session that spawned it, and its output
# paths are tracked files.
#
# ⛔ HOW IT DETECTS — PATTERN-FREE, and that is the whole point.
# The first cut matched COMMAND LINES against a list of project tokens, and the maintainer
# refuted it in one question: `caffeinate -i -t 300`, spawned by this session with its cwd
# inside the repo, was invisible to it because "caffeinate" was not on the list. A census
# built from a list of things you thought of cannot see the thing you did not.
#
# So detection is now a property, not a vocabulary — ONE `lsof` call over this uid:
#   * OPEN HANDLE under the repo (any fd, including `txt`, the executing image) -> PROJECT WORK
#   * command line naming this checkout                                          -> PROJECT WORK
#   * cwd under the repo but ZERO handles and no project token                   -> ADVISORY
# ⭐ The cwd/handle split is the discriminator that stops it crying wolf, and it is principled
# rather than an allowlist: **cwd is INHERITED**, so every shell and helper this session spawns
# has one, while a process actually doing project work holds a FILE. Measured: `caffeinate`
# reports `fd=cwd` under the repo and zero handles.
#
# ⛔ SCOPE — a HANDOFF check, deliberately NOT a doctrine and NOT wired into .githooks/pre-commit.
# A commit may legitimately land while a job runs (commit completed work FIRST, then wait for the
# job). A commit-blocking form would punish exactly that behaviour.
#
# HONEST LIMIT, stated so a green verdict is not over-read: it censuses THIS uid's processes, so a
# project job running as another user is not seen; and a process that has finished its writes and
# closed every handle, with a command line naming no repo path and a cwd outside, is invisible to
# both arms. It excludes the caller's own ancestry, and this script plus the harness wrapper are
# also excluded by name because that ancestry walk can truncate when an intermediate shell exits.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/check_no_background_jobs.sh [--all]
#   --all  also list ADVISORY rows (inherited-cwd session infrastructure); never changes the exit code
# Exit:   0 = no project work running · 1 = project work still running · 2 = usage error
