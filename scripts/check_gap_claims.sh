# GAP-CLAIM-CENSUS — a task leaf that ADDS a "nothing checks X" claim must record the CENSUS it
# rests on. Exits NONZERO on breach. Called by scripts/check_doctrines.sh (hook + CI).
#
# ⭐⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS (ported by BEDROCK-MAINTENANCE.2.6 from the originating project, where the
#   defect was a HABIT rather than a slip: three false "nothing checks X" claims in three days, two of
#   them reaching a commit and one REFUTED by the very next slice — the reader it said did not exist
#   existed, and had for weeks). An "X is checked by NOTHING" sentence is not a description — it is a
#   UNIVERSALLY QUANTIFIED CLAIM over the whole tree, i.e. a CENSUS claim, and it is false the moment
#   one reader exists.
# ⭐ AND THE CENSUS IS NOT MERELY DEFENSIVE — IT LOCATES THE DEFECT. In the third occurrence the false
#   claim would have sent a fix at a mechanism that did not exist; running the census instead produced
#   the exact predicate the fix then corrected. That is the argument for blocking rather than warning.
#
# ⛔⛔ STAGED-DIFF-SCOPED, NEVER OVER THE EXISTING TREE. Measured upstream over the closed tracked
#   population: 242 claim lines across 29 task files, 81 with no census in their own section. A blocker
#   firing on 81 pre-existing claims is unusable and teaches bypass. Scoped to what a commit ADDS, it
#   fires on nothing already in the tree. `--all` reports that backlog, advisory, never blocking.
# ⭐⭐ CALIBRATED BY REPLAYING REAL HISTORY, NOT AN IMAGINED PHRASING: over 150 upstream commits the
#   predicate would have blocked 16 added lines in 14 commits, 12 of them genuine unbacked claims
#   (75 % true-positive on the strict reading). Both founding sentences — the active
#   "no instrument in the tree crosses the two" and the passive "is checked by nothing" — are pinned
#   verbatim by `--self-test`.
# ⛔ THE GOVERNED POPULATION IS `docs/tasks/*.md` ONLY (measured: claims in the changelog and the
#   dev notes co-occur with a task-leaf claim in the same commit 76–90 % of the time, so governing
#   them would double-fire). The layer-A resume pointer is excluded STRUCTURALLY — it is byte-capped.
#
# ARCHETYPE: evidence. HONEST LIMIT — this verifies the census was RECORDED, not that it was RUN,
#   nor that its population was right, nor that its conclusion was correct.
# ⚠️ KNOWN FALSE-POSITIVE CLASS (measured upstream at 1 in 13): a line that QUOTES an earlier claim
#   fires it. Accepted: the discharge is one pasted command; it errs toward asking.
# CONTRACT: exit code is the verdict; explains on stderr; deterministic; read-only;
#   staged-scope-aware; path-agnostic; inert out of scope.

# ── the claim predicate ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ⛔ Keyed on `nothing` + a TRANSITIVE VERB, never on the bare word (`nothing else` / `nothing
# shipped` are not claims about the tree). The verb is what makes the sentence quantify over it.
# ⭐⭐ The PASSIVE VOICE is the same claim with the subject moved (`… is checked by nothing`), which
# the first cut upstream missed on its own founding sentence. The participle is what skips the
# idiom `and by nothing else`; irregulars that do not end in `ed` are listed explicitly.
