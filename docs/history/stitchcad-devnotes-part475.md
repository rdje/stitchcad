- ID: `G1-SLICE.4a`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: canonical value/state/provenance plus MeasurementTable body/POM metadata and reference registries.
  Children: .4a.1 (shared length declarations), .4a.2 (measurement metadata/context), .4a.3 (table/signoff).
  Acceptance: all ontology .2.1 fields present; unknowns supply no numeric value; stable landmark/
  procedure references, kind separation and current context validation are explicit and tested.
  Verification: .4a.1/.2/.3 supply canonical length state/source, metadata/targets and named unique
  current table bindings; all ontology .2.1 fields covered structurally. Native/WASM checked,
  metadata runner proof captured; source/physical/formula/profile/release proof remains deferred.
  Commit: children `STITCHCAD-G1-0024` … `STITCHCAD-G1-0028`

[Completed .4a.1 contract and evidence](G1-SLICE-measurements.md) retain the shared length input
boundary unchanged; current metadata children remain below.

- ID: `G1-SLICE.4a.2`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: immutable body/garment measurement metadata with stable lower-snake token, entered unit,
  canonical declaration link, two landmark references, procedure and source; typed current registries.
  Children: .4a.2a (shared machine tokens), .4a.2b (metadata/records + runtime integration),
  .4a.2c (observed CI and metadata signoff).
  Acceptance: missing/foreign/ambiguous landmark/procedure metadata refuses; body/POM never interchanged;
  declaration borrowing preserves source/state without a duplicate value cache. No standards data invented.
  Verification: shared tokens and all metadata/reference fields covered by child contracts;
  observed bf29b03 Rust/doctrine jobs and all steps completed success. Physical/source proof deferred.
  Commit: children `STITCHCAD-G1-0025` … `STITCHCAD-G1-0027`

[Completed .4a.2a contract/evidence](G1-SLICE-measurements.md) preserves the shared token grammar
unchanged; the metadata/runtime child below remains the current unit.

[Completed .4a.2b contract/evidence](G1-SLICE-measurements.md) retains metadata/runtime
implementation scope unchanged; the observed-CI signoff below completes the parent.

[Completed .4a.2c observed-CI contract/evidence](G1-SLICE-measurements.md) preserves its exact
metadata signoff unchanged; the named table slice follows.

- ID: `G1-SLICE.4b`
  Status: `done`
  Children: .4b.1 (individual intent), .4b.2 (set/membership), .4b.3 (structural review).
  Goal: first-class body-to-garment per-POM Ease, signed Length declaration and ordered close/semi/loose
  fit intent; explicit negative-ease authorization, canonical source/state/provenance and current links.
  Acceptance: lookup per POM, kind correctness, declared compression and no default unknown; only typed
  intent here, actual garment fit/physical construction remains G2/G3. Split safely before code if needed.
  Verification: individual .4b.1 and set .4b.2 contracts/mutations plus .4b.3 structural field review
  and full 23-suite milestone green; evaluation/physical/source/release proofs explicitly deferred.
