# BEDROCK-MAINTENANCE.2.2 — RED / GREEN / CONTROL probes for scripts/check_waiver_routing.sh.
#
# The doctrine: a task leaf claiming a gate DOES NOT APPLY must name the leaf that owns fixing
# the gate. A waiver is a bug report about the gate — the highest-signal one it can receive —
# so it must be routed, never left inert.
#
# ⭐⭐ THE ARM THAT MATTERS IS CTRL-1. This check was adopted from a real project, and the
# version there carries a latent FAIL-OPEN that was fixed on the way in rather than inherited:
#   `printf '%s\n' "$added" | grep -qE "$RE" || continue`
# Under `set -o pipefail`, `grep -q` exits at its FIRST match and closes the pipe; once the
# producer is large enough the upstream `printf` takes SIGPIPE (141), and pipefail promotes 141
# to the pipeline's status. The `|| continue` then SKIPS the file — so a large task leaf
# containing an unrouted waiver passes silently. CTRL-1 builds exactly that input and runs BOTH
# implementations: the unfixed form must MISS it, the shipped form must CATCH it. Without that
# arm, "we fixed it" is a claim.
#
# ⚠️ THE THRESHOLD IS NOT A FLAT 64 KiB, and the first fixture was built on that assumption and
# FAILED TO REPRODUCE — the probe caught the over-claim, not review. Measured on this platform:
#   65,606 B -> PIPESTATUS=(0 0)   (no SIGPIPE: writer fits in the pipe + grep's read-ahead)
#  131,139 B -> PIPESTATUS=(141 0) (SIGPIPE, fail-open)
# i.e. the effective bound is the pipe capacity PLUS whatever the consumer buffers before
# exiting. The fixture is therefore built well past the measured band, not just past 64 KiB.
#
# Each probe builds a throwaway git repository, because the check reads the STAGED diff.
