# BEDROCK-MAINTENANCE.2.4 — RED / GREEN / CONTROL probes for scripts/check_task_acceptance.sh.
#
# ⭐⭐ CTRL-1 AND CTRL-2 ARE THE POINT. They are the arms that prove BOX-SCOPING, which is the
# soundness property this check exists for. Both replay measured leakage holes from the project
# this was distilled from:
#   CTRL-1  the evidence is in the FILE but OUTSIDE the box's bullet -> must REJECT.
#           A whole-file grep would PASS this, which is precisely how the looser form gave green
#           on evidence it had never tied to a claim.
#   CTRL-2  the evidence lives in a CO-STAGED, UNRELATED leaf -> must REJECT.
#           That is exactly how one real leaf passed: on tokens belonging to a different tree.
# Without these two, "box-scoped" is a word in a comment rather than a property of the check.
#
# Each probe builds a throwaway git repository, because the check reads the STAGED diff.

- [x] **ADDRESSED (verified)** — before: `test result: FAILED`; after: `test result: ok`.
- [x] **NO REGRESSION** — `cargo test` → `test result: ok. 42 passed; 0 failed`.
