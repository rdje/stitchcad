# SPINE: project identity, hygiene and adopted policy (repo-local lane)

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `SPINE`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: none directly — this tree owns the repository's own discipline surfaces so
  the roadmap lanes can execute inside them (session directives §8, §12–§14, §17, §18)
- Created: `2026-09-29`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Make this repository *look and behave like StitchCAD* rather than like the template it was
generated from, and adopt the director's external policy references into repository-owned,
mechanically-enforced form:

- identity surfaces de-templated (README landing page, mdBook identity, live status, toolbox,
  knowledge map);
- artifact-cleanup cadence recorded and honoured;
- README policy refreshed to the revised source, claim-verification policy adopted in-repo;
- live-document size containment adopted for the surfaces that are about to grow;
- every path repository-relative and every project-owned artifact on the repository volume.

## Non-Goals

- Product specification or code (that is `G0-CONTRACT` and the `G1-SLICE`+ lanes).
- Weakening any doctrine gate to make a slice land. A cap is never raised to fit content;
  content is demoted (see `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` §6, `README_POLICY.md`).
- Writing to any other git repository. External policy sources are read-only references;
  what is adopted is copied into this repository.

## Acceptance Criteria

- No tracked document introduces this project as the bedrock template.
- The mdBook names StitchCAD, builds with `make book`, and has a SUMMARY that the G0 spec
  chapters can grow into.
- `docs/ARTIFACT_CLEANUP.md` exists, carries exactly one entry (the latest), and the cleanup
  it records was actually run with a residue census.
- The adopted policy copies are repository-owned, carry a local adoption note, and are
  enforced by a check in `scripts/check_doctrines.project.sh` (the project slot), not by prose.
- `make gate` and `make check` stay green at every leaf.
- Each completed leaf is committed through `COMMIT.md`.

## Task Tree

- ID: `SPINE`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: the repository's own surfaces are project-shaped, bounded and enforced.
  Children: `.1` … `.5`

- ID: `SPINE.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: de-template the identity surfaces — `README.md` as the StitchCAD landing page (within
  the reviewed caps), `docs/book/book.toml` identity, `docs/book/src/introduction.md`, and a
  `SUMMARY.md` skeleton with the `spec/` part that `G0-CONTRACT` fills. Owns defects D3, D4.
  Acceptance: `head -1 README.md` names StitchCAD; `mdbook build docs/book` succeeds; the
  README quick start and links are verified by running them; `README-STABILITY` green.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPINE.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: first artifact cleanup + the cadence record `docs/ARTIFACT_CLEANUP.md` (single latest
  entry: date + one-line summary). Owns defect D8.
  Acceptance: cleanup ran on the repository volume only (`target/`, stray `.log`/`.bin`,
  doctrine scratch dirs); a residue census proves what was removed is gone; `make check` still
  green afterwards; nothing tracked was deleted.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPINE.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: adopt the revised external policy references into repository-owned copies — refresh
  `README_POLICY.md` (authority/provenance note, duplication probe, routing-pressure closure,
  derived caps, unconditional check) and add the claim-verification standard in-repo, wired
  into the bootstrap reading list. Owns defects D11, D12.
  Acceptance: the adopted copies carry a StitchCAD adoption note and no external absolute
  path; the README guard still passes and additionally validates its routed destinations where
  the revised policy requires it; a decision record names what was adopted and what was
  deliberately not (donor-specific values).
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPINE.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: adopt live-document size containment for this repository — surface inventory,
  lifecycle class, health target and enforcement ceiling per governed surface
  (`MEMORY.md`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `DEV_NOTES.md`, `LIVE_STATUS.md`,
  `docs/TASK_TREE.md`, `docs/tasks/*`, `docs/decisions/*`, `docs/book/src/*`), plus a
  deterministic ratchet check registered in the project doctrine slot. Owns defect D13.
  Acceptance: the checker runs unconditionally in the hook and fails on an unclassified or
  over-ceiling surface; its RED arm is demonstrated (a control that has been seen to fire);
  ceilings are derived from the measured survivor with modest headroom, not copied from a
  donor project; existing pressure is recorded as transition debt with an owner.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPINE.5`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: seed the orientation surfaces — `TOOLBOX.md` project-toolbox rows for the instruments
  that exist (doctrine enforcer, per-check `--self-test` arms, `make check`/`gate`/`book`,
  the knowledge-map generator) and `knowledge-map/subsystems.md` rows for the documentation
  surfaces. Owns defects D7, D9.
  Acceptance: no placeholder token remains in either file; every listed tool is invoked at
  least once and its real output shape recorded; the Knowledge Map regenerates in sync.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `SPINE.1` | `pending` | after `PLANNING.2`/`.3` — identity before content, so the G0 spec chapters grow into a named book |
| 2 | `SPINE.2` | `pending` | cleanup cadence is a session-directive obligation and cheap |
| 3 | `SPINE.3` | `pending` | policy adoptions bind how every later claim and cap is written |
| 4 | `SPINE.4` | `pending` | containment must exist before 15 spec chapters arrive |
| 5 | `SPINE.5` | `pending` | toolbox rows are honest only once the instruments are in use |

## Decisions

- `2026-09-29`: adopted policy is **copied into the repository** and enforced here; the
  external references are read-only and are never a build input (session directives §12
  exception, §21). A repository that must reach another checkout to know its own rules is not
  relocatable.
- `2026-09-29`: project-specific gates go in `scripts/check_doctrines.project.sh`, never in
  the universal driver (`DOCTRINE_ENFORCEMENT.md`).

## Open Questions

- Whether the containment checker (`.4`) should be one script or reuse the existing
  `check_readme_stability.sh` + `check_memory_architecture.sh` with a new registry-driven
  surface check beside them. Decided inside `.4` with the measured inventory in hand.

## Blockers

- None.

## Acceptance Checklist

Documentation and one project-slot script change (`.4`); the leaves that stage a script fill
this checklist with their own tool output at that time.

- [ ] **ROOT CAUSE (WHY + WHERE)** — _per leaf; D1–D13 census in `PLANNING.md` is the tree-level cause_
- [ ] **ADDRESSED (verified)** — _per leaf_
- [ ] **NO REGRESSION** — _per leaf: `make gate` + `make check`_
- [ ] **FIX** — _per leaf_
- [ ] **LOCKSTEP** — _per leaf_

## Verification Log

| Date | Leaf | Checks | Result |

## Commit Log

| Leaf | Commit subject or reference | Notes |

## Changelog

- `2026-09-29`: Tree created by `PLANNING.1`; owns startup defects D3, D4, D7–D9, D11–D13.
