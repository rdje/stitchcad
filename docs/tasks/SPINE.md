# SPINE: project identity, hygiene and adopted policy (repo-local lane)

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `SPINE`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: none directly — this tree owns the repository's own discipline surfaces so
  the roadmap lanes can execute inside them (session directives §8, §12–§14, §17, §18)
- Created: `2026-09-29`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Make this repository *look and behave like StitchCAD* rather than like the template it was
generated from, and adopt the director's external policy references into repository-owned,
mechanically-enforced form:

- identity surfaces de-templated (README landing page, mdBook identity, live status, toolbox,
  knowledge map);
- artifact-cleanup cadence recorded and honoured;
- README policy refreshed to the revised source, claim-verification policy adopted in-repo;
- live-document size containment adopted for the surfaces that are about to grow;
- every path repository-relative and every project-owned artifact on the repository volume.

## Non-Goals

- Product specification or code (that is `G0-CONTRACT` and the `G1-SLICE`+ lanes).
- Weakening any doctrine gate to make a slice land. A cap is never raised to fit content;
  content is demoted (see `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` §6, `README_POLICY.md`).
- Writing to any other git repository. External policy sources are read-only references;
  what is adopted is copied into this repository.

## Acceptance Criteria

- No tracked document introduces this project as the bedrock template.
- The mdBook names StitchCAD, builds with `make book`, and has a SUMMARY that the G0 spec
  chapters can grow into.
- `docs/ARTIFACT_CLEANUP.md` exists, carries exactly one entry (the latest), and the cleanup
  it records was actually run with a residue census.
- The adopted policy copies are repository-owned, carry a local adoption note, and are
  enforced by a check in `scripts/check_doctrines.project.sh` (the project slot), not by prose.
- `make gate` and `make check` stay green at every leaf.
- Each completed leaf is committed through `COMMIT.md`.

## Task Tree

- ID: `SPINE`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: the repository's own surfaces are project-shaped, bounded and enforced.
  Children: `.1` … `.8`

- ID: `SPINE.6`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: track the workspace lockfile so a fresh clone's first `make check` leaves the tree
  clean (defect D14). Inserted ahead of `.1`–`.5` because the pivot rule defines
  handoff-ready as *no untracked files*, and the toolchain itself was breaking it.
  Acceptance: `Cargo.lock` is tracked; `make check` from a clean checkout ends with an empty
  `git status --short`; `.gitignore`'s stated policy (lockfile deliberately not ignored) holds.
  Verification: recorded below.
  Commit: `STITCHCAD-SPINE-0006`

- ID: `SPINE.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: de-template the identity surfaces — `README.md` as the StitchCAD landing page (within
  the reviewed caps), `docs/book/book.toml` identity, `docs/book/src/introduction.md`, and a
  `SUMMARY.md` skeleton with the `spec/` part that `G0-CONTRACT` fills. Owns defects D3, D4.
  Acceptance: `head -1 README.md` names StitchCAD; `mdbook build docs/book` succeeds; the
  README quick start and links are verified by running them; `README-STABILITY` green.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPINE.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: first artifact cleanup + the cadence record `docs/ARTIFACT_CLEANUP.md` (single latest
  entry: date + one-line summary). Owns defect D8.
  Acceptance: cleanup ran on the repository volume only (`target/`, stray `.log`/`.bin`,
  doctrine scratch dirs); a residue census proves what was removed is gone; `make check` still
  green afterwards; nothing tracked was deleted.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPINE.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: adopt the revised external policy references into repository-owned copies — refresh
  `README_POLICY.md` (authority/provenance note, duplication probe, routing-pressure closure,
  derived caps, unconditional check) and add the claim-verification standard in-repo, wired
  into the bootstrap reading list. Owns defects D11, D12.
  Acceptance: the adopted copies carry a StitchCAD adoption note and no external absolute
  path; the README guard still passes and additionally validates its routed destinations where
  the revised policy requires it; a decision record names what was adopted and what was
  deliberately not (donor-specific values).
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPINE.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: adopt live-document size containment for this repository — surface inventory,
  lifecycle class, health target and enforcement ceiling per governed surface
  (`MEMORY.md`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `DEV_NOTES.md`, `LIVE_STATUS.md`,
  `docs/TASK_TREE.md`, `docs/tasks/*`, `docs/decisions/*`, `docs/book/src/*`), plus a
  deterministic ratchet check registered in the project doctrine slot. Owns defect D13.
  Acceptance: the checker runs unconditionally in the hook and fails on an unclassified or
  over-ceiling surface; its RED arm is demonstrated (a control that has been seen to fire);
  ceilings are derived from the measured survivor with modest headroom, not copied from a
  donor project; existing pressure is recorded as transition debt with an owner.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPINE.5`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: seed the orientation surfaces — `TOOLBOX.md` project-toolbox rows for the instruments
  that exist (doctrine enforcer, per-check `--self-test` arms, `make check`/`gate`/`book`,
  the knowledge-map generator) and `knowledge-map/subsystems.md` rows for the documentation
  surfaces. Owns defects D7, D9.
  Acceptance: no placeholder token remains in either file; every listed tool is invoked at
  least once and its real output shape recorded; the Knowledge Map regenerates in sync.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPINE.7`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: prove and publish defect **D15** — the spine's `TASK-ACCEPTANCE` gate judges the FIRST
  box matching each label in a staged tree file, so in a multi-leaf file one leaf's evidence
  answers for another leaf's code change (false GREEN), and an earlier unticked placeholder
  rejects a leaf that carries real evidence later in the same file (false RED). Deliverable: a
  committed probe (`docs/tasks/artifacts/task_acceptance/run_multileaf_shadowing_probe.sh`,
  a first-class diagnostic tool per `TOOLBOX.md`) with RED/GREEN/CONTROL arms, plus the local
  authoring convention recorded as a layer-C decision.
  Acceptance: the probe runs by one command, prints `probes: N pass / 0 fail`, and its arms
  reproduce both directions; the convention (per-leaf `### <leaf-id>` checklist subsections,
  added in the same commit as the work; no unticked placeholder boxes in tree files) is written
  into `docs/tasks/TEMPLATE.md` and the existing tree files; the finding is recorded with its
  measured evidence and flagged to the director as an upstream spine defect.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPINE.8`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: close D15 locally with a project-slot doctrine — `FRESH-ACCEPTANCE-EVIDENCE`: a staged
  CODE change must be accompanied, **in the same commit's diff**, by added ticked ROOT CAUSE /
  ADDRESSED / NO REGRESSION bullets carrying tool-output signatures, inside a `### <leaf-id>`
  subsection of a staged `docs/tasks/*.md`. Registered in `scripts/check_doctrines.project.sh`
  (never in the universal driver), with `--self-test` arms including a control seen RED.
  Acceptance: previously-committed evidence cannot satisfy a new code commit (the false GREEN is
  closed); an honest leaf whose checklist is added with its work passes regardless of its position
  in the file (the false RED is closed); `make gate` green; a `TOOLBOX.md` row names the check and
  what question it answers.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `SPINE.6` | `done` | taken out of order: it repaired a dirty-tree defect found on the first `make check` |
| 1 | `SPINE.7` | `pending` | D15 is live now and judges every future code commit; proving it is a one-file probe |
| 2 | `SPINE.8` | `pending` | the local mitigation must land before `G0-CONTRACT.18` stages the first code |
| 3 | `SPINE.1` | `pending` | identity before content, so the G0 spec chapters grow into a named book |
| 4 | `SPINE.2` | `pending` | cleanup cadence is a session-directive obligation and cheap |
| 5 | `SPINE.3` | `pending` | policy adoptions bind how every later claim and cap is written |
| 6 | `SPINE.4` | `pending` | containment must exist before 18 spec chapters arrive |
| 7 | `SPINE.5` | `pending` | toolbox rows are honest only once the instruments are in use |

## Decisions

- `2026-09-29`: adopted policy is **copied into the repository** and enforced here; the
  external references are read-only and are never a build input (session directives §12
  exception, §21). A repository that must reach another checkout to know its own rules is not
  relocatable.
- `2026-09-29`: project-specific gates go in `scripts/check_doctrines.project.sh`, never in
  the universal driver (`DOCTRINE_ENFORCEMENT.md`).
- `2026-09-29`: a defect found in the **inherited spine** is fixed locally in the project slot and
  reported to the director, never patched into the universal checks — those are shared, portable
  code kept in sync by `scripts/update_scaffold.sh`, and a local edit there would be silently
  overwritten or, worse, silently diverge (defect D15 → `SPINE.7`/`SPINE.8`).

## Routing Evidence

Defect **D15** is a property of `scripts/check_task_acceptance.sh`, which this repository inherits
from the bedrock spine, so the durable fix belongs to the spine's own maintenance and is reported to
the director rather than patched here (session directive §21: other repositories are read-only).

- **Does it reproduce outside this repository's own tree files?** Yes, by construction: the
  first-match-per-file scan is in the shared script, and the probe builds throwaway repositories
  containing none of this project's files. The behaviour is a property of the spine, not of our leaves.
- **What was measured:** two arms of a scratch probe over the shipped check — ARM-1 (leaf A ticked
  above, leaf B unticked, code change owned by B) → `task-acceptance: OK …`, `exit=0`; ARM-2 (same
  file, order reversed) → three `box is present but NOT ticked` refusals, `exit=1`. Same code change,
  opposite verdicts, differing only in the order of two sections in one file.
- **What would make this routing wrong:** if the spine documented one-checklist-per-file as an
  authoring contract, ARM-1 would be an author error rather than a gate gap. The check's own header
  claims the opposite — it states that box-scoping closed "a co-staged unrelated leaf supplying the
  evidence" — and its probe suite (`docs/tasks/artifacts/task_acceptance/`) exercises that leakage
  only across FILES, so the claim is broader than the property it verifies.
- **Local mitigation owned here:** `SPINE.8` (`FRESH-ACCEPTANCE-EVIDENCE` in the project slot).

## Open Questions

- Whether the containment checker (`.4`) should be one script or reuse the existing
  `check_readme_stability.sh` + `check_memory_architecture.sh` with a new registry-driven
  surface check beside them. Decided inside `.4` with the measured inventory in hand.

## Blockers

- None.

## Acceptance Checklist

### `SPINE.6` — track the workspace lockfile (defect D14)

- [x] **ROOT CAUSE (WHY + WHERE)** — the bootstrap commit never ran cargo, so the generated
  lockfile was absent from the index while `.gitignore` deliberately does not ignore it:
  `make check && git status --short` → `?? Cargo.lock`; `git check-ignore -v Cargo.lock` →
  `rc=1` (not ignored); `.gitignore` line: `# Note: Cargo.lock is intentionally NOT ignored —
  binary/application projects should commit it for reproducible builds.`
- [x] **ADDRESSED (verified)** — `git ls-files --error-unmatch Cargo.lock` → `Cargo.lock`,
  `rc=0` (tracked); `git status --short` after `make check` → empty, so a fresh clone that runs
  the documented check stays handoff-ready.
- [x] **NO REGRESSION** — `make check` → `cargo fmt --check` clean, clippy clean,
  `test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed`; `scripts/check_doctrines.sh` → `=== all doctrines
  green ===`, `rc=0`.
- [x] **FIX** — `git add Cargo.lock` (no hand edit: the file is cargo-generated).
- [x] **LOCKSTEP** — D14 logged with its reproduce command and owner in `PLANNING.md`; this
  leaf records the fix; `MEMORY.md` unchanged (frontier did not move).

Leaves `.1`–`.5`, `.7` and `.8` each add their own `### <leaf-id>` subsection here, in the same
commit as their work; this file carries no unticked placeholder boxes (the reason is D15).

## Changelog

- `2026-09-29`: Tree created by `PLANNING.1`; owns startup defects D3, D4, D7–D9, D11–D13.
- `2026-09-29`: `SPINE.6` added and landed out of order — defect D14 (untracked `Cargo.lock`).
- `2026-09-29`: `SPINE.7`/`SPINE.8` added to own defect D15 (multi-leaf acceptance-evidence
  shadowing in the inherited gate); routing evidence recorded; frontier re-ordered so the
  mitigation lands before the first code leaf (`G0-CONTRACT.18`).
