# Operation limits and progress

The [command-layer contract](command-layer.md#6-structured-errors-and-progress) requires bounded
inputs, declared progress and atomic cancellation. The [execution guide](command-execution.md)
describes implemented metadata operations. Installed input policy, real pre-effect progress and
cooperative atomic cancellation cover individual/group metadata previews, commits and history traversal.

## Explicit finite metadata admission

CommandOperationLimits::new takes three explicit NonZeroUsize maxima. There is no guessed default.
check_mutation and check_group borrow original typed inputs and return CommandOperationDemand or
the first CommandOperationLimitError. They perform no model, registry, authority or history lookup.

| Unit | What counts |
| --- | --- |
| members | every original submitted member, including an exact retry alias |
| targets | one Measurement, selected Material Pieces, or one Notch-owning Piece |
| reason_bytes | exact UTF-8 unresolved reason bytes for each proposed selected Piece assignment |

These are declared metadata input units. They are not observed CPU time, total model memory,
temporary allocation peaks, numeric complexity, file/decompression bounds or geometry/solver work.
Unavailable SplitSeamSpan/CloseDart handlers contribute no implemented metadata targets or reason
bytes; their submitted members still count. Admission supplies no handler availability or execution.

```rust
// The host supplies all three validated positive maxima explicitly.
let limits = CommandOperationLimits::new(
    maximum_members, maximum_metadata_targets, maximum_assignment_reason_bytes,
);
let demand = limits.check_group(&group)?;
let submitted_members = demand.members();
let primary_target_selections = demand.targets();
let proposed_assignment_reason_bytes = demand.reason_bytes();
```

For example, assign the nonblank reason `é` to two Pieces, change one Measurement, then submit an
exact alias of that first assignment. The three submitted members contain five target selections
and eight proposed reason bytes: the reason has two UTF-8 bytes, copied into two proposed assignments
per submitted assignment member. The alias still counts for input admission; runtime replay semantics
remain separate. The native contract case admits exactly 3 members, 5 targets and 8 reason bytes.

Member-count excess is checked first. Then each original member checks targets before reason bytes.
Members retains maximum/requested counts. Targets retains maximum, preceding count, this member's
count, original zero-based index and payload-derived command. ReasonBytes retains maximum, preceding
bytes, selected copy count, exact bytes per copy, original index and command. The exact multiplicative
components remain available even when a requested total would exceed the platform count range.

The check compares against remaining room before adding or multiplying. It neither wraps, saturates,
clips input nor silently deduplicates members. Original contexts, payloads, identities and order remain
unchanged. Private limit fields expose immutable getters; compiler privacy rejects direct widening.
An admitted demand is data, not authority or a commit capability.

## Install trusted policy once

Every bus starts without operation policy. The trusted composition root must install explicit limits
before costly metadata operations; no request, observer or constructor supplies a hidden default.

```rust
let mut bus = CommandBus::with_edit_capacity(
    garment, trusted_authority, reserved_identities, maximum_committed_groups,
)?;
bus.install_operation_limits(CommandOperationLimits::new(
    maximum_members, maximum_metadata_targets, maximum_assignment_reason_bytes,
))?;
let result = bus.commit_group_with_progress(&group, &observer)?;
```

All four maxima in this example are host-chosen positive NonZeroUsize values. Installation changes
no model, grant, revision, reserve, audit or history. A second installation returns
CommandControlError::LimitsAlreadyInstalled and retains the original policy. Compiler privacy also
rejects direct policy reset. Missing policy returns LimitsNotInstalled on costly metadata paths.
Authorized GetPieceList inspection remains available without operation policy.

Pure submitted-input admission runs before authority lookup and private model work. It therefore
can refuse oversized input without consulting the installed source or emitting progress. Within
policy, original authority, binding, envelope, registry and target failures retain their typed causes.
An unauthorized request emits no progress. History admission covers the complete submitted original
group before constructing its current-operator authorization context. Exact aliases count in admission.

The existing preview, preview_group, commit_group and apply_history methods use the unit observer;
they enforce the same installed policy. Their explicit observer counterparts are preview_with_progress,
preview_group_with_progress, commit_group_with_progress and apply_history_with_progress. Availability
queries for preview/commit handlers require installed policy; availability supplies no permission,
remaining quota or candidate validity.

## Declared progress fractions

CommandProgress::new takes a CommandProgressPhase, completed count, positive total and optional
original member index/CommandId. A completed count above the total returns CommandProgressError
with the exact supplied counts. Zero total cannot be supplied through NonZeroUsize. Valid fractions
include `0/3` and `3/3`; `4/3` is refused rather than clipped.

```rust
let progress = CommandProgress::new(
    CommandProgressPhase::Preparing, completed_members, positive_member_total,
    Some((original_index, command_id)),
)?;
let declared_fraction = (progress.completed(), progress.total().get());
```

Fractions are local to their named phase. Authorized, SnapshotBound, Preparing, CurrentValidation,
CandidateValidation, AllocationPreflight, ReadyToPublish and Replaying are declared pre-effect steps.
ReadyToPublish means preparation is ready; it does not report a published model. The eventual success
response acknowledges completion. Constructing phase data proves no actual source check or effect.

## Data-only continuation decisions

CommandProgressObserver receives readonly CommandProgress and returns CommandProgressDecision::Continue
or Cancel. It cannot return a candidate model, replace an authority provider or mint a publication token.
The unit observer ignores progress and continues. No measurement values, labels or model handles are
present in progress data. Actual validation phases surround actual current/candidate validators;
Preparing counts original submitted members, including exact aliases. Fractions are phase-local,
not an overall time estimate. Observers must return promptly: checkpoints are cooperative, not
preemption of a running validator or a wall-clock watchdog.

Returning Cancel produces CommandControlError::Cancelled with the exact observed progress. Private
staged candidates are discarded. The original model/revision, reserved identities, audit records,
history stacks, issued counters and accepted keys remain unchanged. Retrying the same refused keys
can succeed. A cancellation after real candidate validation or after the first staged Notch therefore
consumes no original identity. Internal reserved collection capacity may grow during allocation preflight;
it is not published semantic state.

Closed audit records and return payload copies are prepared before the last ReadyToPublish checkpoint.
Fresh complete effect authorization follows that checkpoint, so observer-triggered revocation refuses
publication. No observer or large payload preparation runs after that final authorization. Publication
uses exclusive infallible state moves; cancellation cannot roll back an already published operation.
ReadyToPublish is preparation progress, not completion; only the successful response confirms effects.

Exact replay refreshes authority and emits Replaying before returning the original record. Cancelling
that retrieval changes no state and does not undo its previously accepted effect. Replay neither
advances audit sequence nor traverses history again.

Seven native runtime-control cases plus the previous37 command-bus cases pass focused checks, with
eight compiler privacy cases, strict selected lint and formatting. The four pure admission/fraction
cases remain separately established. Full command integration and deeper source/allocation acceptance
remain separately owned. These input units do not establish total model/work/memory or future
numeric/file/decompression/geometry/solver bounds; that remaining resource scope is G1-SLICE.6.8.2.
